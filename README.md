# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project
We have made a quizzz application. This application consists of a game with 2 possible game modes. First of all you can play single player. In this game mode you will try to beat your own high score by answering the questions right and as quick as possible. The other game mode is multiplayer. In multiplayer you will compete against different players to get the highest score out of the players in your lobby. The goal of the game is to have fun and become a bit more aware of our energy usage.

## How to run it
There are two possible options to run the project. If you would want to use the first option, you should first start the server out of Intellij where you run the Main class in the server subdirectory. After the server is up and running, you have to start the client side. You achieve this by running the Main class in the client subdirectory. There is one downside to this approach: if your machine is misconfigured you will get a lot of errors. The second option is to run the project using Gradle. You first start the server by starting the gradle.build file in the server subdirectory and the build.gradle file in the client directory after the server is up and running.
## How to contribute to it
If you want to contribute to the project, you create a local branch from the developper branch. You make the changes you want to make. After you are done you push the newly created branch with your changes to gitlab. You create a merge request with explanation to merge with the developper branch. Your code will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the team. If they think changes are necessary they will comment on your merge request with a request for changes. If they deem your code adheres to our coding standards, then they will approve your request.
