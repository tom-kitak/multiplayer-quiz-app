## We agreed on
* Everyone said that they are familiar with scrum, sprints etc. and watched videos.

* We will operate in sprints in one week.
* First priority is to make a working game then add fancy features.
* We are going to work with development branch

    * In Java dock include the name of creator
    * Camel case
    * Parentheses on the same line as method definition
    * At least 1 space between methods
    * Lines shouldn’t be so long you can’t see them whole on the screen
    * Spaces between operators
    * Source files are encoded in UTF-8.
    * Proper variable names
    * We can’t have empty files
    * Always use curly brackets when using if, when, for... statements
